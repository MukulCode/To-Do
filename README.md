# To Do List Application
This application completely related to an assignment provided by "XYY"(using name is not a good idea).

Must watch [this](https://bit.ly/UCTODOVID) short video to know its working.

Screenshots are [here](https://bit.ly/USTODOSS)

Q: Want to know my coding style??

A: Have a look into my commit history.

## Features of applications
1. User can create tasks  in dashboard.
2. Every task can have multiple subtasks.
3. subtascks can be priotitised by dragging and arranging them in different positions.
4. subtasks, abd tasks can be deleted, marked as complete/incomplete and editable.
5. A sweet splash screen with self designed background is also present.

## Best Practices
1. Try to do a root cause analysis for the issue, if applicable.
2. Reference the issue being fixed in the corresponding PR.
3. Use meaningful commit messages in a PR.
4. Use one commit per task. Do not over commit (add unnecessary commits for a single task) or under commit (merge 2 or more tasks in one commit).
5. Add screenshot/short video in case the changes made in the PR, are being reflected in the UI of the application.
6. Close the issue as soon as the corresponding PR is accepted/closed.

## Some Don'ts
1. Send a MR without an existing issue.
2. Fix an issue assigned to somebody else and submit a PR before the assignee does.
3. Report issues which are previously reported by others. (Please check both the open and closed issues).
4. Suggest unnecessary or completely new features in the issue list.
5. Add unnecessary spacing or indentation to the code.
